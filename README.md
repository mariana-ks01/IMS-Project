# Inventory Management System (IMS)

This is a Java project based on CRUD functionality, which allows an end user to manage an SQL database using a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

The following software needs to be installed on your machine to be able to use this application:
-Java
-MySQL Server 5.7+ (local or GCP instance)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Download this project from the repository
2. Locate the target folder
3. Run the ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies 

This will install the application on your machine with all dependencies needed for it to run successfully.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

### Unit Tests 

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

Unit tests are located inside C:\Users\mniko\Desktop\IMS\IMS-22JulyEnable3\src\test\java\com\qa\ims\persistence folder.
In order to run, simply go to each class and right-click inside one of the test classes, select: Run as -> 1 JUnit test

### Integration Tests 
Integration tests are located inside C:\Users\mniko\Desktop\IMS\IMS-22JulyEnable3\src\test\java\com\qa\ims\controllers folder.
They are run in the same way as unit tests. 

Integration tests use an h2 database, as well as mock DAO objects in order to simulate a database-manipulation environment. 
They test the controller classes associated with each entity, in order to test whether each one can create, read, update and delete objects.
